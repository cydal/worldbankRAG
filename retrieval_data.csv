Individuals using the Internet (% of population),"**Trend Analysis:**

From 2020 to 2022, the percentage of Brazil's population using the internet decreased from 81.34% to 80.53%. This indicates a slight but steady decline in internet adoption over the past three years.

**Methodological Context:**

The data is derived from the World Development Indicators database maintained by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Internet users are defined as individuals who have accessed the internet within the past three months, using any device. The data is collected through surveys and administrative records, and its reliability is generally considered to be good.

**Implications:**

The decline in internet usage suggests that there may be barriers preventing some Brazilians from accessing or using the internet. These barriers could include lack of access to affordable devices, limited digital literacy, or infrastructure issues in certain areas.

**Narrative Style:**

Despite steady growth in internet adoption over the past decade, Brazil has experienced a slight decline in the percentage of its population using the internet in recent years. This decline, which has persisted for the past three years, may indicate that there are still significant barriers to internet access or usage for some Brazilians. Addressing these barriers could be crucial for ensuring that all Brazilians have the opportunity to participate in the digital economy and access essential online services."
"Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate)","**Unemployment in Brazil: A Decline in Recent Years**

The data indicates a significant decline in unemployment rates in Brazil from 2020 to 2023. In 2020, the unemployment rate stood at 13.7%, while it reduced to 13.16% in 2021, further dropping to 9.23% in 2022. The most recent estimate for 2023 shows a further decrease to 7.776%.

These figures come from the World Development Indicators, a reliable source for socio-economic data globally. The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force that is without work but actively seeking employment.

The decreasing trend in unemployment rates is a positive sign for the Brazilian economy, indicating an expansion in job opportunities and a reduction in joblessness. Several factors may contribute to this decline, such as increased economic growth, government policies, and labor market reforms.

It's important to note that the data is based on modeled estimates, which may differ from actual figures. Nevertheless, the overall trend provides valuable insights into the evolving unemployment landscape in Brazil, highlighting a positive trajectory toward lower joblessness."
Poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day (2017 PPP) (% of population),"**Trend Analysis:**

Between 2020 and 2021, the poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day (2017 PPP) in Brazil witnessed a substantial increase, rising from 2.0% to 5.8%. However, in 2022, a slight decrease was observed, with the ratio dropping to 3.5%. The available data for 2023 does not exhibit any significant change.

**Methodological Context:**

The data originates from the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform, which utilizes primary household survey data collected by government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. It employs a uniform methodology to ensure data consistency across countries.

Poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day is defined as the percentage of the population whose daily consumption expenditure falls below $2.15, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) at 2017 prices.

**Implications:**

The rise in poverty rates in Brazil from 2020 to 2021 highlights the impact of economic disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The subsequent decline in 2022 suggests that government interventions and economic recovery efforts may have had a mitigating effect. However, the persistently high poverty levels in 2023 signal ongoing challenges in alleviating income inequality.

**Narrative Summary:**

Brazil's poverty headcount ratio at $2.15 a day surged from 2.0% in 2020 to 5.8% in 2021, reflecting the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, it marginally declined to 3.5%, indicating a partial recovery. However, the lack of significant progress in 2023 suggests that addressing poverty remains a pressing issue in the country. The data stems from the World Bank's Poverty and Inequality Platform, which employs a rigorous methodology to measure poverty based on household consumption expenditure."
