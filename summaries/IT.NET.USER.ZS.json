"**Trend Analysis:**\n\nFrom 2020 to 2022, the percentage of Brazil's population using the internet decreased from 81.34% to 80.53%. This indicates a slight but steady decline in internet adoption over the past three years.\n\n**Methodological Context:**\n\nThe data is derived from the World Development Indicators database maintained by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Internet users are defined as individuals who have accessed the internet within the past three months, using any device. The data is collected through surveys and administrative records, and its reliability is generally considered to be good.\n\n**Implications:**\n\nThe decline in internet usage suggests that there may be barriers preventing some Brazilians from accessing or using the internet. These barriers could include lack of access to affordable devices, limited digital literacy, or infrastructure issues in certain areas.\n\n**Narrative Style:**\n\nDespite steady growth in internet adoption over the past decade, Brazil has experienced a slight decline in the percentage of its population using the internet in recent years. This decline, which has persisted for the past three years, may indicate that there are still significant barriers to internet access or usage for some Brazilians. Addressing these barriers could be crucial for ensuring that all Brazilians have the opportunity to participate in the digital economy and access essential online services."
